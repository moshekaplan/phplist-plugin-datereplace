# phplist-plugin-datereplace
phpList plugin that replaces [DATE] in emails with the current date

By default, `[DATE]` will be replaced with the output of `date("F j, Y")`, which would be converted into the format `March 6, 2015`. The date's format string can be replaced with any custom string.

Tested and works with phpList v3.3.1 (Aug 17, 2017)
